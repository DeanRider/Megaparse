# Megaparse
Parses mpileup files to get counts of indels and mutations

This script will scan a directory to create a list of input mpileup files generated by Megamap/quickmap using samtools (contains Mpile in the filename).
It will then use each file in the list it created
and manipulate field 5 to separate characters.
Each character represents a match or mismatch type. 
awk will determine the counts of indels and matches; mismatch 
is the difference between depth and matches.

The data will then be printed out on a per line basis (e.g. each reference position). Summary report data is listed as:

chromosome position reference_base Number_insertions Number_deletions Number_matches Number_mismatches

The script then invokes a perl script called pileup2baseindel.pl written by Jiang Li (https://github.com/riverlee/pileup2base) to generate a more detailed report that includes counts of each type of base and strings representing the individual insertions or deletions.
